## Using This Template
* Clone this repository to your GitHub Desktop application, changing its name to something relevant for your project. For instance, if your project is about visiting the Biltmore in Asheville, North Carolina, you might use the name _Biltmore_ for your copy of the repository.

* Edit the files in the navigation folder to change the text content of the site header, the menu bar, and the footer. The content in these places is the same throughout the site.

* Change the background colors of the site in the main.css file in the css folder. Look for comments in main.css that indicate where to change the different sections of the page.

* Upload your own cover photo to the images folder, and change the filename in the main.css file in the css folder. The cover image is the same size as a Facebook cover photo (851px wide by 315px high).

* Duplicate the index.html file to add more pages to your site. Give your duplicate files  meaningful names that relate to the content that the page will contain. For example, choose _about.html_ for a page that tells readers about your site or topic. Avoid names like _page2.html_ that are not meaningful.
